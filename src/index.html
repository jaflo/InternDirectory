			<h2>FAQ</h2>
			<p>Questions you might have.</p>
			<h3>Why isn't the directory up yet?</h3>
			<p>I just want to make sure that the directory has enough entries to be worth sharing and that it doesn't have any blatant errors. This takes some time.</p>
			<h3>Who is this for?</h3>
			<p>Mainly CS students at the <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">University of Texas at Austin</a> that want to help or get help from their fellow students.</p>
			<h3>Why can't I join the directory?</h3>
			<p>Did you sign in with your UT Google account? You need to have access to an @utexas.edu email address to join.</p>
			<h3>Why can't I view the directory?</h3>
			<p>Did you sign in with your UT Google account? Have you filled out the survey? You need to join the directory before you can view it.</p>
			<h3>How can I edit my response?</h3>
			<p>Head over to <a href="https://goo.gl/eJSH65">this form</a> and follow the link to edit there.</p>
